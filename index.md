## Currently

Building a research-engineering hybrid profile. My ambition is optimizing efficiency and environmental impact of the current AI stack, improving models and training algorithms and developing real-world applications on the edge. To achieve this I'm specializing in ML, NLP, DL and AI, while following courses such as Distributed Systems and Computing Infrastructures.

Always seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects in AI and sustainable technology.

### Research Ambitions

Statistical Learning, Machine Learning, Energy-Efficient AI, Neuromorphic Computing, Sustainable Technology.

### Beyond academics

Neuroscience, reading, music-making and climate change. I've taken part to a philosophy study group for the last 3 years.
